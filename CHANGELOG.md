## [7.0.0] - 2024-12-14

There are so many changes in this version that I may have missed some.

### Added

- Documented upgrade to .NET 8, .NET 9 and rewriting of the framework.
- A lot of interfaces, such as `IAggregate` and `IEvent`, allowing to use your own implementation of those concepts.
- The `IEventStore` interface and its `EventStore` implementations.
- Integration of [EventStoreDB/Kurrent](https://www.eventstore.com/).
- Loading an aggregate from a snapshot.

### Changed

- Migrated to .NET9.
- Upgraded NuGet packages.
- Refactored domain exceptions.
- Rewrote the framework while focusing on event streams as well as aggregates. Previous versions database entities are not compatible with v7+.
- Aggregate `Apply` methods must be renamed to `Handle`, in accordance to C# event terminology.
- The `AggregateId` is now the `StreamId`.
- The `IAggregateRepository` and `AggregateRepository` have been renamed to `IRepository` and `Repository`.
- The `DomainEvent` is back to a _record_.
- Refactored exceptions.
- The `EventSerializer` can now be overloaded to register custom converters.
- Aggregate `LoadFromChanges` method is back to an instance method (not static anymore).
- The `IRepository` now allows loading deleted, undeleted and any aggregates (`includedDeleted` is now `isDeleted`, a nullable boolean).
- Rewrote unit and integration tests according to the framework changes.

### Fixed

- A bug when deserializing empty `ActorId`, `AggregateId/StreamId` and `EventId`.
